Welcome back, aspiring TypeScript Technocrat!



In Module 1, you conquered the basics and wrote your first TypeScript program. Now, buckle up as we delve deeper into the world of TypeScript types!



This module focuses on advanced type manipulation techniques that will enable you to write even more robust and flexible code. Here's what you'll explore:



1. Type assertion/type narrowing:



 Sometimes TypeScript might be unsure of a variable's type. We'll learn how to give hints (type assertions) and refine types (narrowing) for better code safety.



2. Interface, type vs interface: 



Remember data types like numbers and strings? Interfaces are like blueprints for your objects, defining their structure. You'll learn the difference and how to use them effectively.



3. Introduction to generics: 



A generic is a feature that allows a function, class, or interface to work with different types of data.



4. Generics with Interfaces:



 Combine the power of interfaces and generics! Learn how to build functions that work with objects following specific blueprints (interfaces), keeping your code safe and reusable.



5. Function with generics: 



Craft functions that can handle different data types using generics. We'll show you how to define what types your functions can work with.



6. Constraints in typeScript:



 Sometimes, you might want to limit the types generics can work with. We'll explore constraints, like setting rules for what types are allowed in your generic functions.





7. Constraint using key of: 



Get even more control! Learn how to use a tool called "keyof" to define constraints based on an object's properties.



8. Asynchronous typeScript:



 Web development often involves waiting for things. We'll show you how to handle these situations (asynchronous) safely and clearly in TypeScript.



9. Conditional Types:



 Imagine types that change based on what happens in your program! Discover conditional types, a powerful feature for creating dynamic type structures.



10. Mapped types: 



Want to transform existing types into something new? Explore mapped types, a technique for reshaping types based on your defined rules.



11. Utility Types: 



TypeScript comes with built-in helpers (utility types) that offer common functionalities. We'll explore these helpers to make your code shorter and easier to maintain.



By conquering these topics, you'll be well on your way to becoming a TypeScript whiz and crafting superior web applications!
